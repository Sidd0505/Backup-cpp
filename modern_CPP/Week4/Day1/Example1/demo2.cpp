/*
    I want to design an application to process 10 recent trasactions made by a user by 
    fetching their deails from the database 

    Operation:
        Each transactions amount, time, and receipent has to be printed to a log file

    Note 1: transaction has no reliability with others i.e. all transactions are
            mutually exclusive
        
    Every transaction has following state

        transaction time | amount | source | destination 
*/
//object ka structure = state
//Ans : probably array

/*
    Example 2:
     I want to design a application where a new data value is received at a fixed
      interval and gets added at the back of the data values so far. I want to 
      process only the oldest value from these values at a time and print the value
      on the console 

      I am not allowed to modify any received value and for as a value gets processed,
      it needs to be removed from the transaction pending set. 

ANs: Queue based on linked list
