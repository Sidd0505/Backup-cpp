Design a functionalities interface for the following :

1. A function that accepts a container of integers and prints every odd number from that container

2. A function that accepts a container of integers and prints the count of elements divisible by 4

3. A function that accepts a container of integers and prints the sum of the largest and second largest number in the container

4. A function that accepts a container of integers and prints the minimum element 

5. A function "operation" that accepts a container of functions 1 to 4 (described above)
and a container of integers. Operation should apply all functions one by one on the passed
data

Note: 
1. The container of functions should allow contiguous allocations of elements but also allow 
 dynamic resizing
2. the container of integers should be a fixed size container of 5 elements
3. the function 3 and 4 need to be created as a temporary (using lambda functions)
4. Comments for documentation and explanation of any complex logic is mandatory
5. The solution created must include relevant mechanisms to cover all "corner cases" and types of input scenarios
6. Exception handling, whereever applicable, must also be a part of client code
